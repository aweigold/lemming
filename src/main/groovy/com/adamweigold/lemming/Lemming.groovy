/**
 * Provides a builder pattern for asynchronously collecting results from one or more {@link Callable}s.
 * <p>
 * This can be invoked in the following manner from Java:
 * <pre>
 * <code>Lemming{@code <Collected>} lemming = Lemming.makeLemming();
 * Collection{@code <Collected>} results = lemming.add(new Callable{@code <Collected>}() {
 *     public Collected call() throws Exception {
 *       return new Collected();
 *     }
 *   }
 * ).add(new Callable{@code <Collection<Collected>>}() {
 *     public Collection{@code <Collected>} call() throws Exception {
 *       return Arrays.asList(new Collected(), new Collected());
 *     }
 * }).collect();</code>
 * </pre>
 * Since {@link Callable} is a {@link FunctionalInterface}, this can be simplified in Groovy:
 * <pre>
 * <code>def results = Lemming.makeLemming().add {
 *   new Collected()
 * }.add {
 *   [new Collected(), new Collected()]
 * }.collect()</code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param < T > the type of result to be collected
